# dRep
My Cardano dRep public info
I don't expect to get any governance voting delegation, this dRep account is intended for my own use to act as a direct voter, but of course any person is welcome to delegate if they agree with my vision.
I'll vote against most, if not all kind of expenditures.
I'll vote in favor of most if not all kind of technical improvments.
Never buring. Never changing max supply.
My vision is that Cardano will become the web3 equivalent to AWS, Azure, Google cloud, ie: a service layer for individuals, but most importantly for companies, to build their systems.
I think monetary value will be realized once "real world" companies start building web3 applications, when the first laws or judicial rulings recognize that tokenization and NFT are a valid representation of real world asses (RWAs) ownership. At that point, that inflection point, Cardano because of all its technical advantages will be the objective best choice to build upon. Ultimately, because of PoS and fees distribution to delegators, it'll be possible to make a discounted free cash flow (FCF) analysis with a resulting valuation, which at that point Cardaano and ADA wont be a speculative asset anymore, thus differenciating itself once more from the rest of the crypto ecosystem.
